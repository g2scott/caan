Welcome to the Athlete Nominations App!

The Canadian Amateur Athlete Network is always looking for ways to promote our fantastic Canadian amateur athletes in any way we can. Weâ€™re all about 
giving you more exposure, and we want you to have fun too! The Athlete Nominations app was created just for you. Now you can showcase your talent, 
share clips with your friends, nominate other athletes, and last but not least: gather votes! 

At the end of the year, the clip with the most votes will win a Grand Price of $10,000!

Got some cool trick you can do, an awesome talent, or some really funny or entertaining moves? Film it! Then upload it to the Athlete Nominations 
app. Share it with your friends, and invite them to join and vote for their favourite videos. 

The clips can be viewed over and over, and you can save your favourites for easy viewing. 

This is a great way to create your own athlete highlight reel, and an excellent venue to expose yourself to talent scouts as well! 

Download the Athlete Nominations app here, and get in on the fun now! 

This fabulous app supports all smartphone platforms, and accepts videos in all kinds of formats. Easy, fun and entertaining!
