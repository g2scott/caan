2 - Information We Collect and How We Collect It

Information about you that we get from social networks (like Facebook):

If you participate in any competition arranged by CAAN, or upload any video, or place a comment on any video, or otherwise access any of our other 
Services on a social network like Facebook, CAAN receives certain information about you from the social network automatically. The information we 
receive depends on the CAAN content you’re accessing, the information you input, the social network, and your privacy settings and your friends’ 
privacy settings on that social network.

For example, CAAN may collect and store some or all of the following information provided by the social network:

Your first and last name
Your profile picture or its URL
Your social network ID number (like your Facebook ID number), which is linked to publicly-available information like your name and profile photo
The social network ID numbers and other public data for your friends
The login e-mail you provided to that social network when you registered with it
Your physical location and that of the devices you use to access our Services
Your gender
Your birthday and/or age range
Other publicly-available information on the social network; and/or
any other information that you or the social networks share with CAAN.

If you access our Services from a social network, you should also read that social network’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

If you are unclear about what information a social network is sharing with us, please go to the social networks where you play access our content to 
find out more about their privacy settings.

Cookies and Automated Information Collection
We and service providers acting on our behalf, like Google Analytics, store log files and use tracking technologies such as:
Cookies, which are small pieces of data transferred to your mobile device or computer for record-keeping purposes
Web beacons, which let us know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened
Tracking pixels, which allow us or our advertising partners to advertise more efficiently and effectively
Local shared objects, also known as flash cookies, which help us to reduce fraud, remember your in-app preferences and speed up load times.

We and our service providers use these log files, tags, and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain kinds of technical information, 
including:
IP addresses
The type of computer or mobile device you are using
Your operating system version
Your mobile device’s identifiers, like your MAC Address, Identifier For Advertising (IDFA), and/or International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)
Your browser types
Your browser language
Referring and exit pages, and URLs
Platform type
The number of clicks on a page or feature
Domain names
Landing pages
Pages viewed and the order of those pages
The amount of time spent on particular pages
Province and the date and time of activity on our websites or apps.

In some cases, we will connect this information with your social network ID or CAAN user ID.

Please note that companies delivering advertisements on our Services may also use cookies or other technologies as described below in Third Party 
Advertising Including Tailored Advertising and Analytics, and those practices are subject to those companies’ own policies.

For more information on how to limit the types of cookies you allow, please see Opting out of Cookie Tracking.

Other Information from Your Mobile Device:
If you upload videos to the CAAN app or participate in discussions on your mobile device, in addition to your device identifiers, we may also collect:
The name you have associated with your device
Your telephone number
Your country
With your permission, your specific geolocation and your mobile contacts (as further described below in “Information About Your Contacts”).

If you want to adjust your privacy preferences on your mobile device, please see How to Access, Update and Manage Your Information.

Information About You That You Share With Us Directly:
When you use our Services (whether through a social network or through CAAN directly), you may give us information directly (like when you’re setting 
up your account) and we will store that on our systems and use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

Some areas of our app or parts of our Services may use a more traditional registration or account set-up process where you may be asked to give us 
some or all of the following information:
Your age or birthday
Your first and last names
Your e-mail address
A password
Other information that helps us make sure it’s you accessing your account or helps us improve our services.
We may also let you create a participant profile, separate from your social networking site profile (for example, your Facebook profile), that other 
CAAN app members can see. Your participant profile may include information like:
A profile photo
Username(s)
Your gender
Biographic details (like your age or age range)
Approximate location information that you provide
Links to your profiles on various social network
Details about the content you have uploaded
A CAAN ID number that is created by CAAN and used to identify your profile.

Certain information in your CAAN profile will be publicly accessible on CAAN’s websites that offer direct access to CAAN competition and content, 
including:
The CAAN competition participant and commentor ID
Your first and last names
Your profile picture.

Your CAAN app ID number used to identify your account and profile will appear in the URL of your profile page. It will only allow access to 
information you make public in your settings.

Information About Your Contacts:
We may give you the ability to import your address book contacts or manually enter them so that you can locate your contacts on CAAN and invite them 
to join you in commenting and voting for your content or other aspects of our Services. You are responsible for getting your contacts' permission 
when you opt to give their contact details to us. We may also get information about you from other CAAN users importing or entering their contacts. 
We use and may store this contact information to help you and your contacts connect through our Services. If you want to remove your contacts stored 
by us, follow the instructions provided in the app and website to request that we remove them from our systems. If you need to enter a password to 
allow us to access your address book, we will not store that password.

Information You Generate Using Our Communications Features:
You may be able to take part in certain activities on our Service that let you communicate or share information not just with CAAN, but also with 
other CAAN competition participants. These include:
Participating in forums and message boards
Posting public comments to other peoples’ profiles
Sending private messages or invitations to other participants and members, either directly on our websites or to their e-mail accounts
Chatting with other participants
Posting photos or drawings and videos.

We record and store archives of these communications, comments, photos, videos and drawings on CAAN's servers to protect the safety and well-being of 
our participants and CAAN's rights and property in connection with our Services and you acknowledge and agree to that.


Customer Support Correspondence:
When you ask for help from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store the contact information you give them (generally, your name and 
e-mail address), information about your activity on our Services, and your CAAN participant and/or social network ID number. We will also store the 
communications you have with the Customer Service team and any information in those communications in order to provide support.

Information You Give Us For Text Messaging Services
We receive and store the information you provide, including your mobile telephone number, when you choose to sign up to receive SMS messages.


Other Sources
We may collect or receive information about you from other sources like third party information providers. We use this information along with 
information you provide us directly, for example, to help you and your friends connect or to serve you advertising more tailored to your interests.

If you would like to learn more about how we keep your information secure, please see Security of Your Information.

3- How We Use the Information We Collect
The main use of the information we collect and store is to provide a better user experience, but there are other uses as well. The uses for which we 
collect and store your information include:
To operate, improve and optimize our Services and our participant’s experiences;
to create your profile, and participate in the competition
To identify and suggest connections with other CAAN participants and personalize our Services to you
To enable participants and viewers to communicate with each other
To provide technical support and respond to inquiries
To help create a safer and more trusted environment for our participants by preventing fraud or potentially illegal activities, and enforcing our 
Terms of Service
To manage and deliver contextual and behavioral advertising
To notify participants of in-app updates, new products or promotional offers
To administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our business partners
To comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have with you or other participants, and to enforce our agreements with third 
parties
To conduct research.

One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to CAAN, we will use it to respond to customer 
support inquiries, and keep you informed of your in-app activity, including comments from friends, let you know about in-app status such as “new 
clips” as well as tell you about nominations and votes. Some messages, like invites for friends to join you in voting, may include your name and 
profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages (e.g. text messages) ("Promotional Communications") directly 
or in partnership with other parties, in accordance with your marketing preferences. Each Promotional Communication will offer you choices about 
receiving additional messages.

4- How We Share Your Information
We may disclose or publish aggregated information (information about you and other participants collectively that is not intended to specifically 
identify you, for example, participants between the ages of 21 and 25 who live in Ontario) and other non-personal information about our participants 
for industry analysis, demographic profiling, marketing, analytics, and advertising, and other business purposes.
In addition, we will share your information (which may include personal information) with third parties (in other words, parties other than CAAN) or 
allow third parties to collect this information from our Services in the following circumstances:

Your Consent
With your consent, we may share your information with third parties or allow them to collect your information from our Services in some ways not 
specifically described in this Privacy Policy.

Friends and Other CAAN Athlete Nomination participants
The Service supports and often encourages you to interact with other participants. For Athlete Nomination app clips, if you upload through a social 
network or register through a social network (for example, Facebook Connect), your social network friends will see your name, profile photo and 
descriptions of your activity.  Other participants may also be able to send you nomination requests or even friend requests through the related 
social network’s communication channels.

Third Party Advertising Including Tailored Advertising and Analytics
We might include advertising on our Services so we can continue to offer many of our Services for free.

We do not actively share personal information with third party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent.

When/if advertisers or ad networks place ads in our Services, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our 
Services:

Performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement)
Aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other participants collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (like 
participants between the ages of 21 and 25 who live in Toronto)
Certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as IDFAs, and de-identified persistent device 
identifiers such as a hashed Android ID)
Your social network ID
Other contextual data about your clips (for example, description of talent and clip length).

The information collected may be used to:
Measure how effective ads are
To offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements for products and services that are more 
likely to appeal to you (a practice known as behavioural advertising)
and/or undertake web analytics (like Google Analytics which is used to analyze traffic and other participant activity to improve your experience).
Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons, and they may 
use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.

Please note, after clicking on a third party advertisement, you may no longer be on a site hosted by CAAN or the social network through which you are 
viewing and participating in Athlete Nomination activities.

If you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties, please see How to Access, Update and Manage Your Information.

Safety, Security and Compliance with Law
Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications in our Services and between You and CAAN may be accessed and monitored as 
needed to provide our Service and may be disclosed:
When we have a good faith belief that we have to disclose the information in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or 
subpoena)
To satisfy any laws or regulations that apply
Where we believe in our sole discretion that the Service is being used in committing a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to share 
information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit risk reduction, and other security precautions
When we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public 
generally
To protect the rights or property of CAAN and other applicable third parties, including to enforce our Terms of Service.


Third Party Service Providers
We will share your information with third party companies to perform services on our behalf, like processing payments, analyzing data, optimizing 
user experience, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to help us in our marketing efforts, including managing and delivering 
contextual and tailored advertisements. We contractually require these third party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the 
information we share with them, and we contractually require them not use your information for anything other than to provide services on our behalf.

Sale or Merger
In the event that CAAN undergoes a business transition, like a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part its assets (like 
selling the app), we may transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in the transition. We will 
make reasonable efforts to let you and other participants know (in the way described in Changes to Our Privacy Policy) of the business transition 
before transferring your personal information.

5- How to Access, Update and Manage Your Information
Information We Receive From a Social Network Where You Participate in our competition or place a Vote From Your Mobile Device
To manage the information CAAN receives about you from a social network, like Facebook, where you share our content or from where you upload content, 
you will need to follow the instructions at that site for updating your information and changing your privacy settings. The privacy management tools 
for applications on Facebook can be found here. To review and update information associated with your CAAN game profile in certain games, visit the 
“settings” page in that game. You also can manage some aspects of information collection and use by visiting the “settings” page of your mobile 
device and reviewing the permissions of each application or “app.”

Once CAAN receives your information from a social network or your mobile device, that information is stored and used by CAAN in accordance with this 
Privacy Policy. You may access and update that information as described below.

Accessing and Updating Your Information Held by CAAN
If you want to review, delete, or change the information CAAN has about you or have additional questions, e-mail us. We will respond to your request 
within thirty days.

Stopping Use of Your Information
If you no longer want CAAN to make active use of your information, you may send an e-mail through the “contact us” portion of our website. Place 
"Delete My Account" in the subject line and include your first name, last name, e-mail address and your social network ID for the social network from 
which you access our Services (if applicable) in the body of the e-mail (for example, your Facebook user ID). We will respond to your request within 
thirty days. Please note that certain records, for example those relating to payments or customer service matters, will be held for legal and 
accounting purposes. If you have sent content through or posted content on the Service, we may not be able to delete it.

Opting Out of Geolocation
If you have previously allowed us to access your geolocation data, you can stop making geolocation available to us by visiting your mobile device's 
settings for the relevant application or the “settings” page for the relevant game.

Opting Out of Promotional Emails from CAAN
If you want to stop receiving promotional e-mails from CAAN, click on the "unsubscribe" link in any promotional email from CAAN or visit the e-mail 
preference page. Please note that once we receive your request, it may take an additional period of time for your opt-out to become effective. Your 
unsubscribe or e-mail preference change will be processed promptly, and in no event longer than ten business days. Please note that by accepting 
these terms of service, it is understood and agreed that you consent to receiving emails and communications from CAAN with regard to Athlete 
Nominations, in accordance with CASL legislation. You can opt out of receiving such communication at any time.

Opting Out of Other Communications
You can opt out of receiving SMS messages (for example, text messages) by texting back STOP to the number we send the text from for that particular 
SMS message program. In some cases a preferences management page will also be available. When we receive an opt-out message from you for SMS 
messages, we may send a message confirming our receipt of your opt-out.

When you install our apps on your mobile device you can choose to receive push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile 
device even when the app is not on. You can turn off notifications by visiting your mobile device’s “settings” page.

Note that if you opt-out of our Promotional Communications or other forms of communication, we may still e-mail or communicate with you from time to 
time if we need to provide you with information about the Service or if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction 
initiated by you or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.

Opting Out of Third Party Tailored Advertising 
If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored web and 
mobile web advertising you may visit the following websites:

Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising; and
Your Online Choices UK website for EU-based advertising.
These opt-out tools are provided by third parties, not CAAN. CAAN does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others 
provide through these tools.

In addition, if you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in apps on your 
mobile device, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device. In addition, you can reset the “Advertising Identifier” (like an 
IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous “Advertising 
Identifier.”

Please note that you may still receive in-app advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising but they will not be based on your activity 
across unrelated web sites or apps.

Opting Out of Cookie Tracking

You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies 
operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and 
manage flash cookies you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.

If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of our Services because CAAN cookies are necessary to track and enhance 
your game activities.

6- Privacy Policies of Linked Third Party Services and Advertisers
Our websites and games may contain advertisements from Third Party Services, which are companies other than CAAN that may link to their own websites, 
online services or mobile applications. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these Third Party Services. If you have 
any questions about how these Third Party Services use your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.



7 - Our Policies Concerning Children
Our websites and apps are not for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. 
Children under 13 should not use our websites or games at any time. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from a child 
under 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove that information from our records.



International Operations and Transfers Out of Switzerland and the EEA

As part of our international operations, we may transfer data to our Affiliates from time to time for our legitimate business purposes. For example, 
CAAN Inc. provides certain services to its Affiliates (which means subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under 
common ownership with CAAN).

We store information about participants and visitors to its sites on servers located in the Canada, and we may also store this information on servers 
and equipment in other countries. When we transfer your personal information internationally we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your 
personal information is treated securely, lawfully and in the manner we describe here. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, 
and so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your information is transferred to or stored, used or processed in, may be different from the 
privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.


8 - How Long We Keep Your Information
How long we retain your information depends on why we collected it and how we use it. We will not retain your personal information for longer than is 
necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements. For instance, we may retain some information for a few years after you have closed 
your account with us if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend or establish legal rights.


9 - Security of Your Information
We implement appropriate security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline, and we are committed to the 
protection of customer information. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy 
Policy.

If you have an account registered directly with CAAN Athlete Nominations, your profile information is protected by the password you use to access 
your CAAN account. It is important that you protect and maintain your CAAN account’s security and that you immediately tell us of any unauthorized 
use of your account. If you forget the password to your CAAN account, the Service allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain 
how to reset your password. If you access our Services through a social network and your social network account is hacked, this may lead to someone 
participating in CAAN competitions and content streaming without your permission. So, be careful to keep your social network account information, 
including your social network account password, secure as well. We urge you to log out of your CAAN account and any social network account you have 
used to access our Services after you use it.

While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and our customer databases and records, no website or 
Internet transmission is completely secure. Although we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, 
hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, we cannot guarantee the security of your information while it is being transmitted to our 
Service. Any transmission is at your own risk. 


10 - Changes to Our Privacy Policy
If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will tell you and other participants by placing a notice on CAAN’s website or its 
equivalent app, or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you prior to the change becoming effective. We may supplement 
this process by placing notices on game blogs, social network pages, and/or forums and on other CAAN websites. You should periodically check 
www.CAANetwork.com and this privacy page for updates.
